        The Bhagvad Gita occurs in the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata, the
        world’s longest epic.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        It is essentially a dialogue between Sri Krishna (accepted as one of the
        10 incarnations of Vishnu) and his friend and disciple for whom he has
        accepted to be a charioteer during the Great War at Kurukshetra. The book
        is a collection of 700 verses and touches upon several aspects of
        spirituality and spiritual practice and duty and how to conduct it apart
        from other things. The book is accepted as a master piece and along with
        the Mahabharata has also been celebrated as a book that accurately
        reflects the human condition in its entirety. It has elements of
        psychology, profound spiritual philosophy, perspectives for self-conduct
        and indeed a perspective towards life. The greater Mahabharata also has
        lessons in governance and other issues. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Gita is a great global treasure with individuals across national and
        community boundaries having read it through the centuries and continuing
        to read it and appreciate its worth. It is for its global appeal that the
        book belongs to all equally and no community can claim a copy right over
        the Bhagvad Gita. As readers of The Gita, one of the greatest things we
        can do is to uphold it as a gift to all humanity from the same Eternal
        Divinity that we, the people of this world know by different names.

        The Bhagvad Gita has been often referred to as the Vedanta-sar or the
        summary of the Vedanta literature. In a way it is a synopsis of the
        spiritual ideas of the Upanishads (word meaning: ‘Sitting near the feet’
        – of a spiritual master). This is clear in a verse from the meditations
        that says..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>All Upanishads are like cows while Gopal Nandana (Sri Krishna, the
        Shepherd) is the milkman (who shall milk the cows – Upanishads). Partha
        is the enjoyer of the milk, while the nectar like milk itself is the
        great Gita.</p>

      May the Song of God make our own lives more melodious and fill it with true and lasting joy and love. May we be blessed with Eternal bliss.
